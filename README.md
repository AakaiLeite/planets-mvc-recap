### 🪐 Planets MVC Recap 🪐

Friday is here but first let's do our Morning Recap 🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂🤸‍♂

Today's Recap is going to be all about our Solar System Planets 🚀

## Instructions

### Clone the Repo and Install NPM Packages

Hint: you have already the package-lock.json. So, after cloning the lab, you should only need to do 'npm install' to download the npm packages that are needed 😉

### 1st Interation: Create a Schema that suits your Planet's Object

After having your project configured, check your '/utils/planets.js'. Everytime you click on the 'Create All Planets' Button on your Homepage, this will grab the Array of Objects that you see on this file and iterate over each one of the elements. With each interation, a Solar System planet (and also the Sun 🌞) should be created inside your MongoDB Database. 

The problem here is that we don't have yet our Schema ready to receive the information of each Object of the Array 😭

<b>It's up to you to edit the planetSchema with all the fields each Solar System Planet Object have in common</b> 😉

Hint: How can you know that you have the Planets inside your DB? MongoDB Compass will be your bff 🚀

### 2nd Interation: Display a Schnauzer Image on your Schnauzer Page

5 random Dog Photos is a cool ideia, but what about my doggo? He's a Schnauzer Miniature and he needs a single page for him. 

To do that, check your GET '/schnauzer' Route and the API Documentation that you have already. 

After having the data with you, display it on the Browser, using your <b>schnauzer.hbs</b> file. 

<b>Hint: do not forget that 'Schnauzer' is a breed and 'Miniature' a sub-breed 🧐 </b>

### Bonus: CSS, CSS, CSS 🎉
